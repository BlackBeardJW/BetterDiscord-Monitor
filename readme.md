## 📂 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- Windows OS (other platforms are untested)

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Build Executable (Optional)
If you want to create a standalone EXE:
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico main.py
⚠️ Note: Because this tool interacts with other processes and is unsigned, Windows Defender or other antivirus programs will likely flag it as potentially unwanted software. This is expected. You can verify all source code here.

4️⃣ Running From Source
To run the monitor directly:
python main.py
It will start monitoring Discord and show logs in the console.

5️⃣ Heartbeat Plugin
Copy Heartbeat.plugin.js into your BetterDiscord plugins folder:
%appdata%\BetterDiscord\plugins
Enable it in BetterDiscord settings.

🛠️ How It Works
A background process checks:

Whether Discord is running.

Whether Discord has updated.

Whether the heartbeat file is being updated by the plugin.

If the heartbeat is stale or Discord updates:

It automatically launches the BetterDiscord installer.

Logs are saved to logs.txt.

A tray icon provides a quick way to exit or open a live log viewer.
